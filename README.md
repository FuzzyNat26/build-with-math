# Build With Math

## Introduction
Build with Math is a project (game) for learning mathematics while 
exploring about some valuable structures in my Country, Indonesia.

The project consists of four kinds of levels: addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, and division. Each level is generated by a custom 
question generator with sound effects and structure animation.
